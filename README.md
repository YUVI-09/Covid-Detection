# Covid-Detection
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a significant challenge to global public health. One of the areas where machine learning can play a crucial role is in the early detection of COVID-19 cases. Chest X-ray images can provide valuable diagnostic information for COVID-19 detection. In this project, we explore the use of machine learning techniques for COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images. The task is to classify an input chest X-ray image as either COVID-19 positive or negative, which is a simple binary classification problem. However, the challenge lies in developing accurate models, especially in the absence of a balanced dataset. In this study, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. We evaluate various machine learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks, and compare their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in COVID-19 detection and emphasize the importance of developing accurate models for timely and effective diagnosis.
